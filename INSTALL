 * This is modified work by Miroslav Madzarevic githubcode@osadmin.com as of May 1st 2002
 * based originally on proxy-2.2.4 program by sparlin@openpro.org

IMPORTANT : proxylb now works well in the background.

INSTALLATION

Edit the makefile to make any necessary changes.
	+ Should be fine for Linux...

At the prompt type 'make'
	+ Install (just copy) proxylb where ever you see fit.
    Remember to put the config file (config.txt) in the same dir as proxylb
or use -c /etc/proxylb/config.txt (or whatever place you put it in, whatever
name you give it) as a command line parameter when starting proxylb

AFTER INSTALLATION

Read README file so that you know how to setup the small and simple config file.

To get help type:

    ./proxylb --help

To start proxylb on port 2121 on all interfaces in background daemon mode 
using ./config.txt type:

./proxylb -s 2121  

For my development I use gcc 3.0.4, glibc 2.2.5 and kernel 2.4.16. 
This is a box I maintain myself based originally on RedHat 6.2

We've had success stories of using proxylb on Red Hat, Mandrake, Suse,
Debian and Sun.

Have fun, send patches, fixes, money, greetings to githubcode@osadmin.com

God bless OpenSource !
