version 1.0.3
    proxylb runs in foreground and in background without any problems
    all logging is done via syslog only when -d (debug) flag is set on the command line
    almost nothing (except for the one time startup messages) is printed on stdout
    code looks much better (I reformated it) :)

version 1.0.2
    Fixed parse problems on 2.9x gcc (now compiles on suse)
    proxylb runs only in foreground (quick fix for background deamon craching)
